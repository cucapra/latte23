LATTE is a venue for discussion, debate, and brainstorming about language-oriented approaches to hardware acceleration.
The focus is on new languages and tools that aim to let domain specialists, not just hardware experts, produce efficient accelerators.

LATTE '23 is co-located with [ASPLOS '23][asplos-23].
It will happen on Sunday, March 26, 2023 in Vancouver, BC, Canada.

## Call for Participation

LATTE wants your participation!
You can just attend and discuss, or you can also submit a two-page position paper.
(Accepted papers will come with short talks at the workshop to help drive discussion.)
Check out the [call for participation][cfp] for details about how to submit a position paper.

## Registration

To attend LATTE, please [register for ASPLOS][asplos-reg].
